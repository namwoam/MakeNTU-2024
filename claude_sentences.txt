The pursuit of general purpose AI systems has lead to the development of capable end-to-end trainable models [1,5,8,13,19,25,27], many Of which aspire to provide simple natural language interface for a user to interact with the model。
Imagine instructing 8 Vision system tO Tag the 7 main characters on the TV show Big Bang Theory in this image.
We introduce VISPROG Which inputs visual data (a sin- gle image Or a set of images) along with a natural language instruction, generates sequence Of steps, visual pro- gram 让 you will, and then executes these steps tO produce the desired output。
VISPROG improves upon previous methods for gener ating and executing programs for vision applications。
To demonstrate ils flexibility, we use VISPROG for 4 dif- ferent tasks that share some common skills (e.8一 for j- age parsing) While also requiring some degree Of special- ized reasoning and visual manipulation capabilities。
